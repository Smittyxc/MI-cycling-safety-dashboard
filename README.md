## Background
An Excel Dashboard of Michigan cycling safety data, focusing primarily on West Michigan from 2018 to 2022. Data was sourced from the [Michigan Office of Highway Safety Plannning](https://www.michigan.gov/msp/divisions/ohsp). The exploratory analysis found upticks in collisions at certain times of day and in certain speed zones, as well as identified geographic hotspots using mapping functionality. Similarly, analysis was performed on on impaired drivers and found correlations with hit and run rates.
